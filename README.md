# LearningPlatform

This is a project to help me practice with frontend skills.

## Future Goals

I have a few goals with this project for the future.

- I want to make a tool that will be useful to those learning programming/increasing their skills. At first this will contain information at random based on what I am deepening my understanding at the time, but eventually I'd love this to not only replace a coding bootcamp, but also be a resource for intermediate and advanced learning as well.

- I would like to have this project evolve technically over time.

- I would like to eventually have a backend attached to this project as well. Currently, I am leaning towards C#.
